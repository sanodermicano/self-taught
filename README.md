#### Next Skills Prediction:

- The Next Skill will be added automatically to the Skills section and once you master this Skill, Self-Taught will suggest again!
- The Next Skill added will affect the Search Results in the Search Engine.

### Conclude Skills from Links you Provide:
- Registered users can insert links in the link injector and Self-Taught will try to guess the Skill you're trying to learn

## About
Self-Taught is Hassan Al-Nouri's (sanodermicano) and Noor Jaradat's Graduation Project, Hassan had the idea back in 2019, [wrote an idea document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10f1fuN0AOXHndaimc8v4jRIaSGa3DJQ2wlghcB0si28/edit?usp=sharing) and that was the start of a 10 months Software Engineering journey, from Requirements to Deployment, we did all the steps in the entire Software Engineering Life-Cycle, basically we applied what we learned but we also went the extra mile.
